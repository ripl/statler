In this task, the robot sees objects on a table. Some are used for cover, others are regular items. A human user asks the robot to pick up and put down objects, following these rules:
* The robot can grab one object at a time.
* The robot can place an object on a regular item or empty space.
* The robot should put away the top object before dealing with the bottom one.
* The robot can call these functions: `put_first_on_second`, `update_wm`, and `say`.
