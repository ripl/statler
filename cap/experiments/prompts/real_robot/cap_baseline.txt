In this task, the robot sees objects on a table. Some are used for cover, others are regular items. A human user asks the robot to pick up and put down objects, following these rules:
* The robot can grab one object at a time.
* The robot can place an object on a regular item or empty space.
* The robot should put away the top object before dealing with the bottom one.
* The robot can call these functions: `put_first_on_second` and `say`.

### Step 0
# items = ("red apple", "green pepper", "blue mushroom")
# covers = ("cyan bowl", "magenta cup", "yellow lid")

### Step 1
# query: Put the red apple on the green pepper.
say("I will put the red apple on the green pepper.")
put_first_on_second("red apple", "green pepper")

### Step 2
# query: Put the yellow lid on the blue mushroom.
say("I will put the yellow lid on the blue mushroom.")
put_first_on_second("yellow lid", "blue mushroom")

### Step 5
# query: Put the cyan bowl on the green pepper.
say("The green pepper is under the red apple. I shall put away the red apple first.")
put_first_on_second("red apple", "empty space")
say("Now I can put the cyan bowl on the green pepper.")
put_first_on_second("cyan bowl", "green pepper")

### Step 6
# query: Put the magenta cup on the blue mushroom.
say("The blue mushroom is under the yellow lid. I shall put away the yellow lid first.")
put_first_on_second("yellow lid", "empty space")
say("Now I can put the magenta cup on the blue mushroom.")
put_first_on_second("magenta cup", "blue mushroom")

### Step 7
# query: Put the blue mushroom on the red apple.
say("The blue mushroom is under the magenta cup. I shall put away the magenta cup first.")
put_first_on_second("magenta cup", "empty space")
say("Now I can put the blue mushroom on the red apple.")
put_first_on_second("blue mushroom", "red apple")

### Step 8
# query: Put the blue mushroom on the green pepper.
say("The green pepper is under the cyan bowl. I shall put away the cyan bowl first.")
put_first_on_second("cyan bowl", "empty space")
say("Now I can put the blue mushroom on the green pepper.")
put_first_on_second("blue mushroom", "green pepper")

### Step 9
# query: Put the red apple on the green pepper.
say("The green pepper is under the blue mushroom. I shall put away the blue mushroom first.")
put_first_on_second("blue mushroom", "empty space")
say("Now I can put the red apple on the green pepper.")
put_first_on_second("red apple", "green pepper")

### Step 10
# query: Put the green pepper on the blue mushroom.
say("The green pepper is under the red apple. I shall put away the red apple first.")
put_first_on_second("red apple", "empty space")
say("Now I can put the green pepper on the blue mushroom.")
put_first_on_second("green pepper", "blue mushroom")

### Step 11
# query: Put the green pepper on the red apple.
say("I will put the green pepper on the red apple.")
put_first_on_second("green pepper", "red apple")
