In the following, the robot deals with dirty and clean blocks.
A clean block becomes dirty when it touches another dirty block.
This includes when a dirty block is stacked on top of a clean block, and also when a dirty block is right under a clean block.
The table, bowls and the robot gripper are protected from any dirtiness, so they stay clean forever.
When a dirty block is put into the disinfector, it becomes clean immediately.

Instruction:
Aside from the built-in python functions and statements, the robot can only run the following functions:
`put_first_on_second`, `say` and `update_wm`.

Each code is carefully designed by professionals to meet all of these requirements.
