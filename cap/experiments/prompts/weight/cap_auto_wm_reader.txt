In the following, the robot picks and places blocks with different weights.
A query will describe the relative weights of some of the blocks.
Aside from the built-in python functions and statements, the robot can only run the following functions:
`put_first_on_second`, `say`, and `update_wm`

Each code is carefully designed by professionals to meet all of these requirements.

If there is a state dictionary, you should generate functions based on the information in the state dictionary!!

### example 1

# state = {objects = ["red block", "purple block", "gray block", "black block", "cyan bowl", "red bowl"]}

### Step 0
# query: The red block has the same weight as the gray block
update_wm("The red block has the same weight as the gray block")

### Step 1
# query: Put the purple block in the red bowl
put_first_on_second("purple_block", "red bowl")
update_wm("Put the purple block in the red bowl")

### Step 2
# query: The gray block is twice the weight of the purple block
update_wm("The gray block has twice the weight of the purple block")

### Step 3
# query: The purple block is of the same weight as the black block
update_wm("The purple block has the same weight as the black block")

### Step 4
# query: Put the gray block in the cyan bowl
put_first_on_second("gray block", "cyan bowl")

### Step 5
# query: Put the blocks in the red bowl so that their total weight becomes identical to what is in the cyan bowl
# THINK: In the cyan bowl, we have gray block
# THINK: In the red bowl, we have purple block
# THINK: The purple block has half the weight of the gray block
# THINK: We need to place a block that has `gray_block.weight / 2`
# THINK: The block that has the weight `gray_block.weight / 2` is black block
put_first_on_second("black block", "red bowl")
update_wm("Put the black block in the red bowl")

### Step 6
# query: Is the red block heavier than the purple block
# THINK: The red block has weight `gray_block.weight`
# THINK: The purple block has weight `gray_block.weight / 2`
say("yes")
